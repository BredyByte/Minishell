	* Implement SIGNALS


- Davyd: IT CRASHES WHEN ONLY INTRODUCE SPACES....FOR REAL!?!?
- Davyd: When we try to append to a file, it replaces everything, it just doesnt append. 



- Ruben: I have to return status code from the execution of commands properly...I have to check it
- Ruben: There are some commands that trigger double free in my pipex..I have to redefine it so I can 
	free it properly

	Check that
