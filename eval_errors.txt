- TODO: 
	* Implement SIGNALS


- Davyd: IT CRASHES WHEN ONLY INTRODUCE SPACES....FOR REAL!?!?
- Davyd: When we try to append to a file, it replaces everything, it just doesnt append. 
- Davyd: echo Hola | cat -e is ok, but
	 echo -n Hola | cat -e yields free error.. I've tested locally and my code works just fine. We have to look for the error together
- Davyd: same happens with cat infile | more 
	depending on the command, sometimes it crashes
- Davyd: I dont think the parsing of double and single quotes is perfect, we need to test it more deeply



- Ruben: I have to return status code from the execution of commands properly...I have to check it
- Ruben: There are some commands that trigger double free in my pipex..I have to redefine it so I can 
	free it properly




- Both: Apparently we need to store the return status from execution in a variable that represents '$?'
	Check that
