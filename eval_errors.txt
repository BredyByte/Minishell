- TODO: 
	* Implement SIGNALS
	* Implement HERE_DOC
	* Implement ./minishell into ./minishell

- Davyd: IT CRASHES WHEN ONLY INTRODUCE SPACES....FOR REAL!?!?
- Davyd: When we try to append to a file, it replaces everything, it just doesnt append...we need to implement the append 
- Davyd: echo Hola | cat -e is ok, but
	 echo -n Hola | cat -e yields free error.. I've tested locally and my code works just fine. We have to look for the error together
- Davyd: same happens with cat infile | more 
	depending on the command, sometimes it crashes
- Davyd: I dont think the parsing of double and single quotes is perfect, we need to test it more deeply
- Davyd: when I change directories I update env vars, but then I call them with "echo" and the expansion is not correct...Are you using char ** or list *env?? What is updated everytime is the char **env.  
- Davyd: When I check reserved_words[], it doesnt stop at the last cmd, it continues to a 9th one; check it please



- Ruben: I have to return status code from the execution of commands properly...I have to check it
- Ruben: I have to check chained commands when the first one yields error, and see what and when I return it	

- Ruben: I still check with is_builtin from a local array of commands; I have to update it to work with the array of the struct


- Both: I need to review with you about info->status. I am not sure if it is to store exit value from subprocesses or exit value from minishell itself. 
	Btw, when I call "exit" function with no args, for some reason sometimes it works, sometimes it just doesnt.  
- Both: Explain me how did you consider the possibility of here_doc, to see how I can manage it
- Both: Exit doesnt always work, for some reason I dont know
