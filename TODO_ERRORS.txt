- (1)Davyd: Close fd in case of >a>b>c - ✅❗️
- (2)Davyd: implement here_doc - ✅❗️
- (3)Davyd: echo Hola | cat -e is ok, but
	 echo -n Hola | cat -e yields free error.. I've tested locally and my code works just fine. We have to look for the error together - ✅
- (4)Davyd: same happens with cat infile | more
	depending on the command, sometimes it crashes - ✅
- (5)Davyd: I dont think the parsing of double and single quotes is perfect, we need to test it more deeply - ✅
- (6)Davyd: case of "<outfile.txt" gives segment eror - ✅
- (7)Davyd: "cat outfile.txt | more " Two or more commands and second no exist "cat outfile.txt | -ls".
	I'v done it, pipex.c line 92 instead of return, i do exit, and line 98 case for child exit with error ✅
- (8)Davyd: when I change directories I update env vars, but then I call them with "echo"
	and the expansion is not correct...Are you using char ** or list *env?? What is updated everytime is the char **env. - (function implementated - refill_envp_lst(t_info *info, char **new_envp)) ✅
- (9)Davyd:
	* Quotes: Sometimes I cannot execute whats inside quotes. 'ls -la' just doesnt work --> I dont receive properly the char **cmd - We looked and came to the conclusion that this is normal behavior ✅
- (10)Davyd: add "nbsp" (option + space) in parser - part of Davyd (7) ✅
- (11)Davyd: groupig.c refactoring - ✅
- (12)Davyd: here_doc testing - ⛔️
- (12)Davyd: redir ">a>b>c>>a" testing - ⛔️
- (13)Davyd: leaks all code - ⛔️


- Ruben: I have to check chained commands when the first one yields error, and see what and when I return it - ⛔️

-PROBLEMS: 
	* There are some cases where our shell doesnt work as bash:
		- "ec""ho" Hello is executed in bash, whereas in our shell isnt 
		- "cat infile | 2cnd command works just fine, BUT in bash there are some cases where second cmd is not executed
				* For example: "cat infile | exit" or "cat infile | cd" <-------- WTFFFFFFF  
				* Commands that are not executed after a pipe: 
					- export
					- unset
					- cd
					- exit
				* Commands that actually ARE 
					- pwd
					- echo
					- env

- Ruben: 
	* I deleted fork check in "ft_exec_cmd" bcs i didnt know how to refactor it
			if (id < 0)
				return (ft_print_error(FORK_ERROR));
	* Refactor ft_order_env, I dont know how to do it yet

	* Exit abc abc doesnt work properly; change order 
	
	* Optional: I have to consider to implement builtins in child process
