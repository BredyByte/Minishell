- Davyd: Close fd in case of >a>b>c - ⛔️❗️
- Davyd: implement here_doc - ⛔️❗️
- Davyd: echo Hola | cat -e is ok, but
	 echo -n Hola | cat -e yields free error.. I've tested locally and my code works just fine. We have to look for the error together - ⛔️
- Davyd: same happens with cat infile | more
	depending on the command, sometimes it crashes - ⛔️
- Davyd: I dont think the parsing of double and single quotes is perfect, we need to test it more deeply - ⛔️
- Davyd: when I change directories I update env vars, but then I call them with "echo"
	and the expansion is not correct...Are you using char ** or list *env?? What is updated everytime is the char **env. - ⛔️
- Davyd:
	* Quotes: Sometimes I cannot execute whats inside quotes. 'ls -la' just doesnt work --> I dont receive properly the char **cmd



- Ruben: I have to check chained commands when the first one yields error, and see what and when I return it - ⛔️
- Ruben: 
	* cd -> Refactor it
