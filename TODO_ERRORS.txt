- Davyd: Close fd in case of >a>b>c - ⛔️❗️
- Davyd: implement here_doc - ⛔️❗️
- Davyd: echo Hola | cat -e is ok, but
	 echo -n Hola | cat -e yields free error.. I've tested locally and my code works just fine. We have to look for the error together - ⛔️
- Davyd: same happens with cat infile | more
	depending on the command, sometimes it crashes - ⛔️
- Davyd: I dont think the parsing of double and single quotes is perfect, we need to test it more deeply - ⛔️
- Davyd: when I change directories I update env vars, but then I call them with "echo"
	and the expansion is not correct...Are you using char ** or list *env?? What is updated everytime is the char **env. - ⛔️

- Ruben: I have to check chained commands when the first one yields error, and see what and when I return it - ⛔️
- Ruben:
	* Echo: I just saw that if you do "echo -n-n-n-n-n Hola" it has to print "-n-n-n-n-n" without having in account the flag
	* Echo: If i put in the prompt echo "-n Hola" it just doesnt get whats inside quotes (either single or double)
	* Quotes: Sometimes I cannot execute whats inside quotes. 'ls -la' just doesnt work --> I dont receive properly the char **cmd
	* Exit: 
		- It looks like the number of errors are directly related with how many commands we execute during the shell
			-- The more cmds we execute, the more we need to call exit to really exit the shell 
		- see how to manage ret val between cmd returns and exit return (one overwrites the other)⛔️
	* Unset: If unset is called with no args, it jsut doesnt do anything; just return with ret_val = 0;
	* Ret_val from cmds: 
		- Builtins: I am returning -1 as error, but bash does with 1; is it ok if I leave -1 ? -- 
		- CMDs:		Somehow, when a normal cmd doesnt execute properly, I doesnt store the good value -- mine returns 0 
	* unset PATH then executing: I dont know why but I dont yield any error...though in pipex was done but here it just	
								doesnt do it
	* Check all the print messages as well as return values when something go wrong 
	
- Both: I need to review with you about info->status.
	I am not sure if it is to store exit value from subprocesses or exit value from minishell itself.
	Btw, when I call "exit" function with no args, for some reason sometimes it works, sometimes it just doesnt. - ⛔️
- Both: Explain me how did you consider the possibility of here_doc, to see how I can manage it - ⛔️
