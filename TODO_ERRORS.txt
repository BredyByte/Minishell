- TODO:
	* Implement SIGNALS - ⛔️
	* Implement HERE_DOC - ⛔️
	* Implement ./minishell into ./minishell - ⛔️
- PIPEX
	* Doesnt work when manipulating files; infinite loop - ⛔️
-

- Davyd: Close fd in case of >a>b>c - ⛔️❗️
- Davyd: implement here_doc - ⛔️❗️
- Davyd: echo Hola | cat -e is ok, but
	 echo -n Hola | cat -e yields free error.. I've tested locally and my code works just fine. We have to look for the error together - ⛔️
- Davyd: same happens with cat infile | more
	depending on the command, sometimes it crashes - ⛔️
- Davyd: I dont think the parsing of double and single quotes is perfect, we need to test it more deeply - ⛔️
- Davyd: when I change directories I update env vars, but then I call them with "echo"
	and the expansion is not correct...Are you using char ** or list *env?? What is updated everytime is the char **env. - ⛔️
- Davyd:
	* Quotes: Sometimes I cannot execute whats inside quotes. 'ls -la' just doesnt work --> I dont receive properly the char **cmd



- Ruben: I have to check chained commands when the first one yields error, and see what and when I return it - ⛔️
- Ruben:	
	* Ret_val from cmds:
		- CMDs:		Somehow, when a normal cmd doesnt execute properly, I doesnt store the good value -- mine returns 0 
	* unset PATH then executing: I dont know why but I dont yield any error...though in pipex was done but here it just	
								doesnt do it
	* Check all the print messages as well as return values when something go wrong 
	
- Both: I need to review with you about info->status.
	I am not sure if it is to store exit value from subprocesses or exit value from minishell itself.
	Btw, when I call "exit" function with no args, for some reason sometimes it works, sometimes it just doesnt. - ⛔️
- Both: Explain me how did you consider the possibility of here_doc, to see how I can manage it - ⛔️
