	* CHECK LEAKS

- Davyd: Close fd in case of >a>b>c - ✅❗️
- Davyd: implement here_doc -  ✅❗️
- Davyd: echo Hola | cat -e is ok, but
	 echo -n Hola | cat -e yields free error.. I've tested locally and my code works just fine. We have to look for the error together - ✅
- Davyd: same happens with cat infile | more
	depending on the command, sometimes it crashes - ✅
- Davyd: I dont think the parsing of double and single quotes is perfect, we need to test it more deeply - ✅
- Davyd: This case "cat outfile.txt | more " Memmory error - ⛔️
- Davyd: case of "<outfile.txt" gives segment eror - ⛔️
- Davyd: when I change directories I update env vars, but then I call them with "echo"
	and the expansion is not correct...Are you using char ** or list *env?? What is updated everytime is the char **env. - ⛔️
- Davyd:
	* Quotes: Sometimes I cannot execute whats inside quotes. 'ls -la' just doesnt work --> I dont receive properly the char **cmd
- Davyd: add "nbsp" (option + space) in parser



- Ruben:
	* cd -> Refactor it and delete printfs
- Ruben: "echo -n Hola". prints "-n Holaminishell-1.0$" instead of "Holabash-3.2$"
